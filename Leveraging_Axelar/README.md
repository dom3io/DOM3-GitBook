# Leveraging Axelar

Axelar's **General Message Passing (GMP)** protocol enables seamless communication between different blockchains. This means that a developer or platform like DOM3 can call any function on any connected blockchain, ensuring complete composability across the vast Web3 ecosystem.

With Axelar's GMP, DOM3 can initiate calls across chains, attach tokens to these calls, and ensure that these operations are carried out smoothly across different blockchains. This integration ensures that DOM3 remains at the **forefront of cross-chain real estate innovations**, offering unparalleled opportunities to its users.
